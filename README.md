# CT-imaging
Code for reconstruct CT image base on sinogram. 

### Data
- `Data/sinogram.npy`: 512*180
    - assume that every pixel is 2mm * 2mm
    - generated by projecting the image using 180 angles with 1 degree interval.

    ![sinogram](/Source/explain.png)

    - every column in the sinogram corresponds to the 1D projection using one angle and conducted counterclockwise with respect to the center of the image. 

- `Data/output`: 512*512
    - output size will be 1.024m * 1.024m

### Task
- [ ] Implement the back-projection (BP) algorithm and show the reconstruction result.
- [ ] Implement the filtered back-projection (FBP) algorithm and show the
reconstruction result.
- [ ] Write the report to explain all processes, show the results and discuss the results.
